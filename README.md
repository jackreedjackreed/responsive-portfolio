This is the first stage of my responsive portfolio. It contains some biographical information, links to projects I've completed, and a contact page. There's a nav bar with three links and a sticky footer. The repo here contains my files and reference photos.

I initially started the project looking at Bootstrap templates and well-done responsive/dynamic sites. After getting in over my head, I simplified my approach. The site needs some improvements, but I'm happy with how it is at the moment.
